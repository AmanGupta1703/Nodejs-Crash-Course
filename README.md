# Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. It was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and its development and maintenance is now overseen by the Node.js Foundation.

## History

- In 2009, Ryan Dahl created Node.js, inspired by server-side JavaScript frameworks like Jaxer and Narwhal.
- In 2010, npm (Node Package Manager) was created as a package manager for Node.js modules.
- In 2011, Joyent, a cloud computing company, sponsored the development of Node.js and formed the Node.js Foundation.
- In 2015, Node.js and io.js merged back together, ending the fork of the project.
- In 2018, the Node.js Foundation and the JS Foundation merged to form the OpenJS Foundation.

## Features

- Asynchronous and event-driven: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
- Cross-platform: Node.js runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.
- Fast: Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is known for its speed and performance.
- Large ecosystem: Node.js has a large and active community that has created many modules and libraries that can be easily installed and used with npm.
